### Hey there, nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹
I'm a recent graduate with a Master's Degree in Engineering in Computer Science. For my Master's Thesis I worked on a Deep Learning research project involving improving Image Super-Resolution [[SRWaveDiff](https://github.com/aloilor/SRWaveDiff)]. I'm passionate about Deep Learning, Machine Learning and Software Engineering solutions and I'm actively looking for a job in these fields. 

### Education: 
- Master of Science in Engineering in Computer Science @ `Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma`
- Bachelor of Science in Automation and Computer Engineering @ `Sapienza UniversitÃ  di Roma`

### Projects:
- [Wavelet-Based Diffusion Models for Enhanced Inference Speed in Image Super-Resolution](https://github.com/aloilor/SRWaveDiff)
- [Full-stack containerized platform connecting users with skilled professionals](https://github.com/aloilor/rentyourexpert)
- [Modern treasure hunt mobile-app with image recognition, GPS, and competitive gameplay](https://github.com/aloilor/photohunt)
- [Web-based endless-runner car racing game built with three.js and WebGL](https://github.com/aloilor/80s-lofi-run)

### What I'm up to:
- Studying NLP [[Stanford CS224N](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4), [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/), [Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/chapter_attention-mechanisms-and-transformers/index.html#attention-mechanisms-and-transformers)]
